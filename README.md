# Calculator App
<p>This calculator app is going to be a design of a basic calculator that handles strings of additions, subtractions, multiplications and divisions.</p>

<p>3/24/2022: As I'm doing this, the most challenging part that I'm thinking is how I'm going to approach a problem containing multiple operators. Also, I want to try and approach the calculator layout with CSS grid, which I'm going to have to learn.</p>

<p>Learned about event delegation and targetting. This makes handling large number of buttons a lot more easier and efficient.</p>

<p>3/30/2022: Most of the basic functionalities of the calculator are finished. However, there's still a few more things I want to add that won't tack on much to the functionality itself, but for my own learning sake.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure that the back-end functions work as intended by unit testing the edge cases exhaustively using the Jest testing framework </li>
  <li>Make it look nicer :)<li>
  <li>Try and encapsulate the calculator into an object</li>
</ul>

<p>4/21/2022: Haven't put much time into the project since I've been working with interviews and job processes. The functionality of the calculator works. I will make sure to come back to what I plan with testing and what not. But for now, I want to work on the front-end. I will learn CSS Grid and work to make it look like an actual calculator lol</p>
