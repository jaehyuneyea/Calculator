# Calculator App
<p>This calculator app is going to be a design of a basic calculator that handles strings of additions, subtractions, multiplications and divisions.</p>

<p>3/24/2022: As I'm doing this, the most challenging part that I'm thinking is how I'm going to approach a problem containing multiple operators. Also, I want to try and approach the calculator layout with CSS grid, which I'm going to have to learn.</p>

<p>Learned about event delegation and targetting. This makes handling large number of buttons a lot more easier and efficient.</p>
